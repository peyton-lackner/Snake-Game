# Snake-Game
This was for a final project for AP Computer Science A. There are several issues such as the snake sometimes doesn't move if you move to quickly or it kills itself if you turn around too fast. Additionally, the "Play Again" button keeps the original window open.
I may get to these issues in the future, but personal projects are my current priority.
